This is the resource pack for Edument's new Angular course.

In here you'll find:

 * a bunch of **demos** - open `demos/index.html` in a web browser, no installation necessary. However, they must be served over a local web server!
 * the **exercises**, containing...
    * solutions for all individual exercises
    * a blueprint project ( `_seed`) for you to use as a starting point
 * the **slides** for the course in a pdf

If you have any questions, get in touch with [david.waller@edument.se](david.waller@edument.se)!
